An hello-world webserver in C using libuv (https://github.com/joyent/libuv) and
http-parser (https://github.com/ry/http-parser) based on Ryan Dahl's tutorial
http://vimeo.com/24713213 and updated to make it work with the most recent
libuv API.

Build it

git clone https://github.com/ry/http-parser.git
git clone https://github.com/joyent/libuv
make

Run it

./webserver
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Stress-test it

ab -n 5000 -c 500 http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Call for coders!
I have this insane idea of writing a lightweight c++ web framework on top of
libuv. But. I can't do it by myself.
Anyone crazy enough to join me? Drop me a tweet / email.
